### •	**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**


I can ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure by performing the following practices:
- Testing and Code Reviews:

This could be done by implementing a comprehensive testing strategy. Whether that means integrating various tests such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing. Unit testing would be used to help verify that individual components work as needed. Integration testing would be used to help check that different modules or services do interact correctly. System testing would be used in order to validate the entire application. Finally, acceptance testing would be used in order to ensure that the software meets its user requirements. Peer code reviews on the other hand are great for helping identify any potential issues, such as security vulnerabilities that automated tests might miss.

- Security Best Practices:

It is always of best practice to follow secure coding practices, a great tool to use for this is OWASP, since they provide secure coding guidelines. Making sure to incorporate practices in your processes such as setting up proper input validation in order to prevent SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS), encrypting sensitive data, implementing proper authentication and authorization mechanisms are examples of secure coding practices. The conduction of regular security audits or using tools such as static code analyzers could really help in the identification of any security flaws that might be present. Thus, resulting in the opportunity to properly address these security flaws and having them fixed early on in the development process. 

- Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):

Having a CI/CD pipeline with automated tests and security scans incorporated is important because it enables both the continuous testing of code and its deployment. It also permits any code changes to be automatically tested and deployed as well. Thus, reducing the risk of any bugs or vulnerabilities from slipping into production as a result.

- Code Maintainability and Documentation:

It is of utmost importance to write clean, maintainable code while also having proper documentation since this ensures that any future developers or even you included, can easily understand what the code does and modify it without introducing errors. By adhering to coding standards, using version control systems such as Git are helpful to help track changes and also effectively collaborate with others.

- Monitoring and Logging:
  
Tracking application behavior in production can be done through the implementation of robust logging and monitoring. Doing this can help identify issues early and also provides insights into any potential security breaches. 


### •	**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**


I Interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program by:
- Gathering Requirements:

I try to be as thorough as possible while gathering the client’s requirements. I ask them lots of questions in order to get the feel of what they want, need, and their pain points. I might even go as far as showcasing some examples of what can be incorporated and also helps to determine what they like and don’t like. 

Ideally, in the real world, this would involve engaging with stakeholders in order to gather such requirements. These requirements can be gathered through interviews, surveys, and observations. 

- User Stories and Use Cases:

Taking into consideration all of the information gathered, we can use this information to form our user stories and use cases. User stories would help us describe the functionality from the end user’s perspective. Use cases on the other hand, help provide detailed scenarios of how the users will interact with the app.

- Prototype and Feedback:

I always aim to create a wireframe first and then a prototype. As this will allow the client to visualize and interact with what the end product will look and function like. This way we can obtain important feedback on what works, doesn’t work, what they like and don’t like early on in the development process. Then the changes could be made and implemented before formally launching the app.

- User-Centered Design (UCD):

My main focus lies on the needs, wants, and limitations of the user’s needs. I ensure to do so to the best of my ability and knowledge. However, I am aware that there is much more to learn and implement in this area. But with a bit more of experience and exposure, ideally, this step will include creating personas, conducting usability testing, and ensuring that the user experience (UX) is indeed intuitive while also aligning with the user’s expectations.


### •	**How do I approach designing software?**


I approach designing software by aiming to ensure that the final product is both functional and maintainable. In order to do this, I implement the following steps: 
- Analysis of Requirements:

Here I focus on what the software/app needs to accomplish, what its target audience is, and any other constraints or limitations that may be currently present or arise later on before designing. 

- System Architecture Design:

After I have thoroughly performed the analysis of requirements and have a clear vision of what the requirements are, I next process to design the systems architecture. Here I focus on what they key components of the system are, what their interactions are, and of course the technology stack.

- Detailed Design:

After designing the architecture, I then proceed to focus on designing individual components, modules, and interfaces.

- Prototyping:

I always like to create a working prototype in order to see what the design looks like and how everything interacts together before fully implementing the design as this helps in early detection of design flaws that we can later fix before launching.

- Documentation and Review:

This is a great way to organize and document design decisions, their rationale, conducting reviews, and also referenced later when needed.  

- Iterative Refinement:

This design process is iterative and as development progresses, the design might need to be adjusted in order to accommodate any new requirements or address any problems that may have arisen.
